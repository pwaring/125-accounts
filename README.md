# 125 Accounts

125 Accounts is a simple accounts package for self-employed service providers
in the UK.

The name refers to a sketch in Monty Python and the Holy Grail where King Arthur
attempts to count to three. Hopefully this software will be more reliable at
counting.

## Dependencies

 * Python 3.x (development is done in 3.5.x). Python 2 is not supported and is
 unlikely to work, even with major modifications. This is intentional.
